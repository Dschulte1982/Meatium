## Stretch Goals

*Topics/Categories*

* As a reader with particular tastes, I want to be able to both search articles by topic and also browse a specific topic for the most popular/recent articles on that topic so that I feel that the website is relevant to my interests.

*Bookmarks*

* As a busy reader with demands on my time, I want to be able to bookmark an article for reading later so that it doesn't get buried in the feed of new articles coming in.
