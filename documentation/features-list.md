## MVPs


*Stories*

* As a person that has particular interests, I want the ability to find and view articles so that I can educate myself on related topics.

*Commenting on Stories*

* As a person that wants to share my thoughts, I want to be able to leave comments on an article so that my feedback can be seen by everyone else who engages in the discussion in a particular story.

*Follows and Feeds*

* As a person who enjoys chatting with others about my topic of choice, I want to be able to add to the conversation in real-time and see those messages reflected in the server chat.


*Likes*

* As a person who values discretion, or would like to speak directly to one particular user, I want to be able to message a member of a server directly so that I am am able to have a one-on-one conversation.

## Stretch Goals

*Topics/Categories*

* As a reader with particular tastes, I want to be able to both search articles by topic and also browse a specific topic for the most popular/recent articles on that topic so that I feel that the website is relevant to my interests.

*Bookmarks*

* As a busy reader with demands on my time, I want to be able to bookmark an article for reading later so that it doesn't get buried in the feed of new articles coming in.
